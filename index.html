<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Is BlockTracker?.</h3>

<p>BlockTracker is a modification for the Minecraft Server. The existance of this project is drawn from struggle Minecraft servers have without unoffical API's such as Bukkit or MCP. Without those API's many programmers are incapable to create their modifications, be it the extra amount of time that is required, the extra amount of effort, or simply the level of difficulty. That's why I've created BlockTracker. A modification that latches directly into the Minecraft server's core code. As a result, this modification can exist BEFORE API's like Bukkit or MCP have been updated.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Does BlockTracker Do?</h3>

<p>BlockTracker ties into the core Minecraft server code. Whenever a block is broken or placed in the world, BlockTracker's hooks parse the playername, coordinates, and the blocktype from the Minecraft server and into the BlockTracker modification. BlockTracker then connects to a mySQL server configured by you (the server administrator) and inserts that information to database and table.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Development</h3>

<p>BlockTracker was built in two phases over a period of one day. The inital phase was to decompile the Minecraft code and map key methods. After locating these methods it was a matter of parsing all of the variable data and processing it to a nice and clean human readable state, where it could then be inserted into a database for storage.</p>
<p>In the future BlockTracker will be expanded to poses a command line interface from within the game for remote administration and databse inqueries. Also in the works is a command-free database inquery method for quick and easy use.</p>

<p>BlockTracker was originally designed by <a href="https://github.com/Geistes" class="user-mention">@Geistes</a> . The idea was conceived shortly after joining organisation <a href="https://github.com/MCAU" class="user-mention">@MCAU</a> where the largely active Minecraft 1.8 server would often be vandalised without repercussion. Aditional thanks to the gracious help of <a href"=https://github.com/TerrorBites" class="user-mention">@TerrorBite</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ullarah" class="user-mention">@Ullarah</ah in mapping out the obfuscated methods and setting up the environment.</p>
